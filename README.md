## Day 2: Task 1 - FizzBuzz Challenge 🐝

One of the classic interview questions is to implement FizzBuzz in Python. The objective is to iterate through the numbers 1 to 100 and:

- Print `"fizz"` if a number is divisible by 3.
- Print `"buzz"` if a number is divisible by 5.
- Print `"fizzbuzz"` if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5.
- Otherwise, print the number itself.

**Sample Code:**
